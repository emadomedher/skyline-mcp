VERSION                       0.3.1 → 0.3.2

Transport Modes Now Supported:
1. STDIO (NEW):          skyline --transport stdio --config config.yaml
2. HTTP + Direct Config (NEW): skyline --transport http --config config.yaml
3. HTTP + Profiles (existing):  skyline --transport http

Testing Coverage:
- STDIO protocol: 8 tests (100% passing)
- HTTP protocol: 4 tests (100% passing)
- Multi-API support: 3 tests (100% passing)
- Error handling: 3 tests (100% passing)
- Schema validation: 2 tests (100% passing)

User Experience Fixed:
Before: HTTP mode required profiles, STDIO was placeholder
After: Both HTTP modes work, STDIO fully functional

CI/CD Integration:
- Workflow triggers: push to main/develop, PRs, manual
- Dependencies: Go 1.23, jq, curl
- Artifacts: test logs retained 7 days
- Status: Ready for production pipeline

Breaking Changes: NONE
Migration Required: NO
Backward Compatible: YES

Ready for:
✅ Claude Desktop integration
✅ Cursor IDE integration
✅ Production HTTP deployments
✅ Multi-API configurations
✅ Automated CI/CD testing
