### GraphQL Optimization
Automatically reduces GraphQL API tools from 300+ to 20-40 using:
- Type-based pattern detection (CRUD consolidation)
- Smart input flattening
- Response optimization
- **Works for any GraphQL API** (GitHub, GitLab, Shopify, Hasura, etc.)

**Example Results:**
| API | Before | After | Reduction |
|-----|--------|-------|-----------|
| GitLab | 315 tools | 38 tools | 88% |
| GitHub | 203 tools | 28 tools | 87% |
| Shopify | 147 tools | 22 tools | 85% |

See [graphql-optimization.md](./graphql-optimization.md) for full details.
